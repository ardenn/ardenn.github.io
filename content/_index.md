## Hello, I'm Rodgers!

I am a Software Engineer from ~~Homabay~~ Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I love using, designing and building software. I often use Python, Go and Dart for my projects, but also a lil' bit of everything (as dictated by the job at hand).

I have extensive experience with back-end web system design and architecture (microservices et al). I am also experienced in general scripting, front-end web and mobile (mainly Dart/Flutter and JS).

I currently work at [Twiga Foods](https://twiga.shop) as a Senior Software Engineer, where I help build a fast-growing robust system (e-commerce, logistics & supply chain, fintech and digital services).

During my spare time, I read code on Github, just to see what everyone else is doing, and how they're doing it.
I am not very good at writing but [@derrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwitiderrick) encourages me to do some writing every now and then.
I also like to go out for long bike (I mean bicyle) rides, when not catching up on my watchlist.

For projects/contracts, drop me an email at **m<span style="display:none;">SPAM PROTECT</span>e@maka<span style="display:none;">SPAM PROTECT</span>lila.dev** or shoot me a Telegram [@mc_alila](https://t.me/mc_alila). You can also find me on Twitter [@mc_alila](https://twitter.com/mc_alila), it's mostly read-only ðŸ˜….
