## Hello, I'm Rodgers!

A Software Engineer from ~~Homabay~~ Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I love using, designing and building software, with [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodgers-ouma) in back-end web system design and architecture, general scripting, some systems programming, front-end web and mobile. I often use Python, Go and Dart for my projects, but also a lil' bit of everything.

During my spare time, I read stuff on the Internet, to see what everyone else is doing, and how theyâ€™re doing it. I also like to go on bike (read bicycle ðŸ˜…) rides, when not catching up on my watch-list.

For projects, drop me an email at **m<span style="display:none;">SPAM PROTECT</span>e@maka<span style="display:none;">SPAM PROTECT</span>lila.dev** or shoot me a Telegram [@makalila](https://t.me/makalila). You can also find me on Twitter [@mc_alila](https://twitter.com/mc_alila).
