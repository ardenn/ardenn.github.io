## Hello, I'm Rodgers!

I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I love using React, GraphQL, Node, Design Systems and everything in between.

I currently work at Twigafoods as a Lead Frontend Engineer, where I help build fantastic customer-facing products as well as internal dashboards and tooling.

During my spare time, I contribute to some of my favorite Open Source Projects, spending time with my family, watching Liverpool FC play and making road trips to discover new places.
