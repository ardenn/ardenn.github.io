							Its early to mid August, 2016, and I am at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7xNUF6RMMky">Katuky’s</a>, trying to rake in a dime. I take a quick glance at my WhatsApp contact list, and realise I havent spoken to Hazel in a while, exactly two months to be precise.Last I saw her, she had delivered a parcel from home, and I almost stood her up.  She’s the kind of friend you never totally understand, and as such you have carefully scrutinize your diction. Luckily, thanks to Google, I’ve got <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en">Gboard</a>-the Android keyboard powered by the tech giant’s predictive algorithms. At some point in the conversation, she mentions something about being in Ghana and am like,
							</p> 
							<i>“Stop joking, where are you nway, for real?”</i>
							<p>
							That, basically, is how I got to know about <a href="http://meltwater.org/">MEST</a>, and how the journey that got me here started. At that moment, I knew I had to grab that opportunity, and take a step towards achieving one of my life goals.
							</p>
							<p>
							Ladies and gentlemen, it's been almost a month since I came to <a href="http://meltwater.org/">MEST</a>. Looking back, I was never sure of getting in, considering the competition was exceedingly tight. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/clineduros">Celine</a>, it's way easier to get into Harvard than to <a href="http://meltwater.org/">MEST</a>. I would wish to thank God for the gift of life, friends and family for their constant support and of course the <a href="http://meltwater.org/">MEST</a> community for allowing me to be part of their family.
							</p>
							<p>
							Thank you and God bless <a href="http://meltwater.org/">MEST</a>!
